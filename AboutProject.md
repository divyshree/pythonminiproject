QR Code Generator
Project Overview
The QR Code Generator is a Python-based mini-project designed to create QR codes from text or URLs. This project aims to offer a simple tool for generating QR codes, 
which can be used for a range of applications—like quickly sharing links, text, or contact info. Users can also save the generated QR codes as image files, 
which makes them easy to share or embed anywhere.

This project serves as a great beginner-level introduction to Python libraries and working with simple GUIs if opting for the tkinter interface.

Features
Generate QR codes from any text input, including URLs, plain text, or contact details.
Optionally, a GUI is provided to make the process more interactive and user-friendly.
Save generated QR codes as .png files for easy sharing or printing.
Tools and Libraries Used
1. Python
Description: Python is a versatile programming language widely used for various applications,
from web development to data science. In this project, Python serves as the backbone for handling logic and generating QR codes.
Version: Python 3.x
3. qrcode Library
Description: qrcode is a Python library specifically designed for creating QR codes. It allows us to configure the size,
error correction level, and more, making it simple to produce high-quality QR images.
Installation: Install via pip install qrcode[pil].
Usage in Project:
QRCode(): Creates a QR code instance with specified parameters.
Error Correction: Supports different error correction levels to ensure QR code functionality, even if slightly damaged.
Image Generation: Converts the QR code data into an image format (.png) for storage.
5. PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Description: PIL (or pillow) is a Python library for image processing. In this project, it’s used in combination with qrcode to adjust and save the QR code as an image.
Installation: Included with qrcode via pip install qrcode[pil].
Usage in Project:
make_image(): Creates the final QR code image.
resize(): (Optional) Adjusts image size for the GUI.
6. tkinter (Optional)
Description: tkinter is Python's standard GUI toolkit. In this project, tkinter is used to create a simple interface for users who prefer an interactive approach.
Installation: Built-in with Python, no extra installation needed.
Usage in Project:
Entry Box: For user input (text or URL).
Button: To trigger the QR code generation.
Label: For displaying the generated QR code image within the GUI window.
Project Structure
main.py: The primary script containing all the code for generating QR codes and managing the GUI (if included).
generated_qr.png: Example of a generated QR code saved as an image (output file).
aboutproject.md: Documentation file outlining project details and usage.
Getting Started
1. Installation
Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
Install the qrcode library by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install qrcode[pil]
2. Running the Project
Command Line Usage:
Run main.py and enter the data you want to generate as a QR code.
GUI Usage (optional):
If tkinter is included, run main.py to open the GUI. Enter your text/URL, click “Generate,” and see your QR code displayed on-screen.
How to Use the QR Code Generator
Input: Enter the text, URL, or any data you want to encode.
Generate: Run the script or click the “Generate” button in the GUI.
Save: The QR code will automatically save as an image file (generated_qr.png) in the project folder.
Customization Options
QR Code Size: Adjust the box_size parameter in the QRCode() instance to change the QR code dimensions.
Error Correction Level: Set different error correction levels (L, M, Q, H) to increase or decrease the data protection in the QR code.
Background and Foreground Colors: Use make_image(fill='color1', back_color='color2') to change QR code colors.
Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include:

Adding more color options for QR code customization.
Supporting additional file formats (e.g., .svg).
Including a “Save As” option in the GUI to allow for custom filenames or formats.
